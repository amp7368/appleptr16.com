            "A 30-35 hour work week is preferable. A plus is to split up work with frequent breaks. I have an interesting proposal: '6-7 hours of work each day spread out in a 10 hour time period'. A worker with ADHD especially should have the option to leave in the middle of a task and come back later. I think this would avoid burnout and boredom much more effectively. Instead of spending 2 hours enjoying work. Getting bored would cause the rest of the 5 hour work period to be unproductive. People with ADHD have a distorted sense of time, so the bored 5 hours feels like much longer than it actually is. "
